Wireless Clock Synchronization (WCS) Service
--------------------------------------------
With the exception of explicitly wired synchronization, the various clock within the system drifts over time and temperature. The Double Sided Two Way Ranging (DS-TWR) scheme inherently compensates for the clock drift. The WCS service provides a mechanism for explicitly measuring the relative clock skew and compensating for same. With WCS a single-sided two way ranging (SS-TWR) achieves comparable performance to a DS-TWR scheme. With WCS all time measurements are referenced to the master clock, this simplifies the TDOA architecture by distributing the clock synchronization function across nodes.
