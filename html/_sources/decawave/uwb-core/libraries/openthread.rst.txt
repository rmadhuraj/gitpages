Openthread on nrf52832+DW1000 with mynewt:
---------------------------------------------
1. The `uwb-core/lib/openthread <https://github.com/Decawave/uwb-core/tree/master/lib/openthread>`_ enables the support for openthread mynewt by implementing

   - Platform(nrf52832) related abstraction layer.
   - Radio (DW1000) related abstraction layer.
   - Abstraction layer common to the platform, radio, OS and Openthread.
2. It also includes Openthred core pre built Libraries, Openthread stack related headers.
3. The mynewt app ``uwb-apps/apps/openThreadApp`` showcases the various features of openthread on DW1000 (over UWB) with help of mynewt subsytem.
4. Mynewt OS takes care of scheduling various Openthread tasks and events.

**NOTE:** Refer to the `OpenThreadAPP <https://github.com/Decawave/uwb-apps/tree/master/apps/openThreadApp/>`_ for the usage of Openthread on DW1000.
