UWB-CORE
=========

Overview
---------

The distribution <https://github.com/decawave/uwb-core> contains the device driver model for the Decawave DW1000 Impulse Radio-Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) transceiver within the Mynewt-OS. The driver includes hardware abstraction layers (HAL), media access control (MAC) layer, Ranging Services (RNG) and light weight IP (lwip) stacks. The DW1000 driver and Mynewt-OS combine to create a hardware and architecture agnostic platform for IoT Location Based Services (LBS). This augmented with the newtmgt management tools creates a compelling environment for large-scale deployment of LBS. The newt management tool uses a repo methodology for package management. The driver contained herein becomes a dependent repo for any DW1000 related project and is automatically included in projects as required––the <https://github.com/decawave/uwb-apps> showcases this relationship.

This repo also contains the board support package (BSP) for the Decawave dwm1001 module and dwm1001-dev kit. The dwm1001 includes a nrf52832 and the dw1000 transceiver. dwm1001-dev is a breakout board that supports a Segger OB-JLink interface with RTT support. The mynewt build environment provides a clean interface for maintaining these BSPs, and the contained DWM1001 BSP can serve as a template for other DW1000 enabled platforms. The dwm1001-dev and the driver contained herein provide a clean out-of-the-box experience for UWB LBS products.

A single dw1000 transceiver can be used to form a 6LowPAN mesh network while concurrently measuring distance between nodes. Dual DW1000 devices can be used to measure Range and Azimuth also known as Angle-of-Arrival (AoA). With this intent, this driver is thread-safe and multi-instance. The driver has a hierarchical architecture and is partitioned into functional groups.

Under-the-hood
---------------

The uwb-core driver implements the MAC layers and exports a MAC extension interface for additional services, this MAC interface is defined in the struct uwb_mac_interface found in (../master/hw/driver/uwb/include/uwb.h)
